### What does the Russellville-Logan County Human Rights Commission do?

Our commission is focused on helping get people to the resources they need, in order to pursue human rights violations. We listen to complaints, direct people to the appropriate resources, and provide certain resources within our purview (e.g. secured meeting spaces, assistance with filling out documentation)

### What does the commission NOT do?

Our commission does not personally investigate instances of human rights violations. We also do not publicize instances of human rights violations. If a complaint is brought to the commission, we enter a closed meeting with all commissioners and the complainant.

### When does the commission meet?

The commission generally meets on the second Monday of every month, from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM, at the Logan County Chamber of Commerce in Russellville. The public is invited to attend our meetings. Please check our "Calendar of Events" for the most up-to-date information regarding our meetings and other events.

### How do I pursue justice for human rights violations?

- Contact our commission (see "Contact Us" below, or attend one of our meetings).
- File a Complaint with the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights (see "Resources" below).
- Consult a local attorney.
